This project for my Data Science Honors thesis course aims to compare Taiwanese and American media coverage of Chinese activities in the Taiwan Strait using natural language processing techniques. This is informative in explaining how the Taiwanese and American publics differ in their attitudes about the threat posed to Taiwan by the mainland's Communist regime. For more detailed information, see our [Pre-Analysis Plan](notebooks/pre-analysis-plan.md).

### Pre-Analysis Plan

This should be completed after you have your data set but before you begin your analysis. **Make sure to timestamp this document!** This is the whole point of a Pre-Analysis Plan. It should contain the following sections:

| Section | Description |
|-----|-----|
| Abstract  | an abstract for your project, excl. findings  |
| Data  | description of my data set  |
| Strategy  | an outline of the steps I will take to analyze your data  |
| Analysis  | any heuristics or mathematical models that you use, and the reasons for their use  |
| Deliverables  | a description of the deliverable files in the repo, incl. where my presentation is  |
| Sources   | list of sources for my data _and any other research_ that I did  |
